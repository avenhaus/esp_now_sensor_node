# ESP-NOW Sensor Node

Sensor Node sending out encrypted ESP-NOW messages.

They are received by a ESP-NOW to serial bridge and processed by a Home Assistant Custom Component

This allows to create battery powered ESP32 sensor nodes for Home Assistant.

EspHome is great, but it only works with WIFI which is not suitable for long term battery operation.
